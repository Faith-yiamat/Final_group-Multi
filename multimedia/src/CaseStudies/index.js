            Inota is a credit scoring system that offers alternative collateral for Saccos. 
            We collect data from the dairy farmers like <br/> mile collections, savings, regular bills and 
            livestock for loss mitigation to give them a score. The aim is to eliminate the <br/> need of 
            guarantors by farmers during application and give them feedback on rejected loans. 
            The system leverages<br/> machine learning to train a model that is accurate and efficient

            UpcycleIt is a gamified application of the products that helps youths get 
            an awareness of upcycling <br/>and use it in real life. This project is to help
             reduce the dumping of clothes in our society. Our approach <br/>is centered around
             creating an intuitive and user-friendly interface that educates users about the benefits <br/>
             of upcycling and provides them with the tools to participate in the process.

            Our educational app offers a personalized experience for students. Upon logging<br/>
            in, students can access specific sections of a book, handpicked by their teacher.
            Once <br/>they have read the assigned topic, students can test their understanding
            by taking a quiz <br/>tailored by their teacher. After completing the quiz,it 
            will be promptly graded and students <br/>can compare their performance with their 
            peers using a ranking feature. This ranking feature will <br/>display students' usernames, 
            which they can create during their profile setup, ensuring their anonymity.

            Apex Simulation equips teachers of visually impaired students with technical skills on
             how to use assistive technologies.<br/>Our main aim was to ensure the continuation of learning
             the currently available assistive technologies. The teachers are <br/>provided with scenario-based
              in case of another pandemic. Apex Simulation provides a gamified simulation that mimics<br/>
             the currently available assistive technologies. The teachers are be provided with scenario-based
              questions related to <br/>situations they may encounter in class, and will be required to answer said 
              questions through the simulation.
